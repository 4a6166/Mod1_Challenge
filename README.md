Jacob, great job with your pivot table, line graphs and written report, you were able to demonstrate your ability to generate your respective columns and rows in your data creation. Six new columns were correctly created for percent funded, average donation, category, sub-category, Date Created Conversion, Date Ended Conversion. Conditional formatting was applied appropriately to the outcome and the percent funded column. A thing to take note of: Standard Deviation values in Statistical Analysis are not the expected values. Keep the good job.
